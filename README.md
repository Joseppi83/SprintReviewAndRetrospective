# SprintReviewAndRetrospective


## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
A very practical method to interpret user needs is the initial interview between the customer and the Product Owner.  There, the Product Owner will delve as deep as needed to gather every customer want and need and ask more and more specific questions, until all future product ambiguities are cleared.  Another tool the product owner may use is a wireframe for the UI/UX of the product.  This is a graphic prototype of the future product.

User stories enable the development team to understand what the user would like to accomplish or view during the utility of the program.  User stories are a very concise explanation of an item in the product backlog, essentially giving it a bit of figurative life, before it's actually created.


## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
From now on, I will definitely employ the iterative sprints attributed to Agile Scrum.  Additionally, the agile processes I most hope to integrate into my worklife include the Daily Scrum.  This is a 15-minute period where the Scrum Master and Development Team verbally explain what was done yesterday, what they will do today, and what obstacles currently or could exist to undermine project progress.


## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means having great communication skills and the work ethic to complete tasks completely, efficiently, and effectively.
